EjectDisks
===

Experimental RubyMotion program written for OS X.

Purpose: 

* To eject the three external USB disks that I use for Time Machine backup on my MacBook Pro.
* To play with RubyMotion for OS X.
* To make users smile when they choose the 'Say Something' or 'Sing' options on the menu.

Thanks to...

Laurent Sansonetti and Hip Byte for adding OS X as a target for RubyMotion.
Elliott Draper for creating the `osx-status-bar-app-template` gem.
